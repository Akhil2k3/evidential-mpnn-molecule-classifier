# Evidential MPNN for Molecule Classification

This project implements an evidential deep learning framework using a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to classify molecules based on SMILES representations.

## Features
- Atom and bond featurization
- Graph generation from SMILES
- MPNN with Transformer encoder readout
- Uncertainty-aware binary classification

## Dataset
- [BBBP](https://deepchemdata.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/datasets/BBBP.csv) dataset from DeepChem

## How to Run
